  I am a girl who is from Seattle, WA. Soon I will be a senior at Franklin High School. I live at home with my mom, dad and 3 sisters. I am doing <strong>Girls Who Code </strong> this summer at Adobe and I am enjoying it very much so far.

  <h4>Likes:</h4>
  <p>
   During my free time, I like to sleep, run, annoy my sisters, hang out with family/friends and watch Netflix, Hulu, and Anime shows. I love music, especially Pop, R&B and use to be very into K-pop. My <em>favorite </em>boy group is <strong>IKON</strong>. My favorite foods are Sushi and Pad-Thai.
